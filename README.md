# About the Developer

Athelia changed careers to launch a career of creative problem solving, growth, and new challenges. Prior to becoming a SWE student, she worked for a building materials company in a variety of roles, from doing document design and copywriting in the Marketing department to producing the price list and pricing tools in the Sales & Bid Center. For the latter, she developed an automated tool to produce quotes on behalf of sales representatives, reducing errors both in calculation and data entry, and eliminating repetitive calculations. Athelia looks forward to using her experience with this project and her new skills gained through Hackbright to explore even more complex problems and create more tools that will improve people's lives.
